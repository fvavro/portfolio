            <img src="images/portfolio-portrait.JPG" alt="Fanny's Profile Picture" class="profile-picture">
            <p>Hi, I'm Fanny, a UX designer dedicated to creating simple, creative solutions that everyone can use. With a background in environmental studies, I design with sustainability and accessibility in mind.</p>
            <p>Before taking my first computer science class at Brown, I had never thought to program. I really struggled in the following CS classes as well, finding it hard because some people seemed to be good at programming effortlessly while I had to put in more hours and work. However, this experience has given me a solid understanding of the struggles you can face in understanding CS, which has made it much easier to collaborate with individuals who are not CS-trained.</p>
            <p>My design philosophy is to be very transparent and simple. I strive to create designs that are accessible to everyone, regardless of their expertise level or other impairments. This approach ensures that technology can be inclusive and usable by a diverse range of people.</p>
