            <p>Welcome to the fun page! Here are some of my hobbies and interests outside of UX design.</p>
            <div class="fun-item">
                <h2>Dancing</h2>
                <img src="images/dancing.jpg" alt="dancing" class="small-image">
                <p>I have been part of the ballroom dance team for two years now and have been its captain for one year. I also enjoy all kinds of other dances, including West Coast swing, Lindy hop, Argentinian tango, line dancing, bachata, salsa, and merengue. Anything I can get my hands on!</p>

                <img src="images/cooking.png" alt="cooking" class="small-image">
                <p>As a vegetarian, I have fallen in love with food all over again. I enjoy exploring new vegetarian recipes and discovering the amazing things you can do with food.</p>

                <h2>Hiking and Nature Conservation</h2>
                <img src="images/hiking.png" alt="Hiking and nature conservation" class="small-image">
                <p>I have been a scout since I was very small, fostering my connection with nature. This is part of the reason I am studying to learn about how to best protect the environment. I enjoy hiking and engaging in nature conservation activities.</p>
