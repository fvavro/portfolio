            <h1>Responsive Redesign</h1>
            <h2>Context/Problem</h2>
            <p>The existing website for Brown Ballroom Dance was not mobile-friendly, causing users to struggle with navigation on smaller screens.</p>
            
            <h2>Research</h2>
            <p>We conducted user surveys and analyzed competitor websites to understand common issues and best practices, focusing on making the design simple and accessible.</p>
            
            <h2>Process</h2>
            <p>We created wireframes and prototypes, tested them with users, and iterated based on feedback, always prioritizing simplicity and user-friendliness.</p>
            
            <h2>Solution</h2>
            <p>The new design features a responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes, improving navigation and user satisfaction through a clear and simple interface.</p>

            <h2>Learnings</h2>
            <p>I learned the importance of user testing in identifying usability issues early in the design process and the value of designing for accessibility.</p>
            
            <h2>Role</h2>
            <p>I led the design process, conducted user research, and created the final prototypes, focusing on simplicity and accessibility.</p>
