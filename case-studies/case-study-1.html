          <h2>Context/Problem</h2>
          <p>
            The existing website for Brown Ballroom Dance was not
            mobile-friendly, causing users to struggle with navigation on
            smaller screens. The home page was not functional, missing a lot of
            information and potential for announcements and news. As a ballroom
            dancer myself, I have often found it challenging to find information
            on websites from different teams, which are usually more confusing
            than helpful. I believe this website is currently extremely minimal
            in design and has a lot of untapped potential.

          <h2>Current Website Analysis</h2>
          <p>
            This website has a very simple structure, which does make it rather
            easy to navigate and learn. However:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              It is hard to find precise information; the only detailed dropdown
              is for Brown Comp.
            </li>
            <li>
              The home page is not functional, missing a lot of information and
              potential for announcements and news.
            </li>
            <li>
              There is no memorability or impression of the team given to the
              user.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section id="accessibility">
          <h2>Accessibility</h2>
          <p>
            Surprisingly, the website was quite accessible. It had many labels,
            and since it was black and white, the contrast was sufficient.
            However, it sometimes contained text that was too small and was
            missing a few labels and proper organization of lists.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section id="research">
          <h2>Research</h2>
          <p>
            We conducted user surveys and analyzed competitor websites to
            understand common issues and best practices, focusing on making the
            design simple and accessible.

          <h2>Design Process</h2>

          <section id="initial-goals-and-flaws">
            <h3>Initial Goals and Flaws</h3>
            <p>The initial goals of the redesign were to:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Improve the overall navigability of the website.</li>
              <li>
                Make the homepage more functional by adding sections for
                announcements and news.
              </li>
              <li>Create a memorable impression of the team.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Through sketching and analysis, these goals were refined to focus
              on creating an easily navigable web experience for both new and
              experienced ballroom dancers, and incorporating opportunities for
              users to stay informed and engaged.

            <p>
              Here are some initial sketches that outline the proposed redesign
              of the website. The focus was on improving navigation, making the
              homepage more functional, and enhancing the overall visual appeal
              to better reflect the spirit of the Brown Ballroom Dance team.

            <h3>Figma Prototype</h3>
            <p>
              After refining the sketches, I created high-fidelity prototypes
              using Figma. These prototypes are designed to be responsive,
              ensuring a seamless user experience across different devices. Key
              features proposed in the Figma prototype include:

        <section id="conclusion">
          <h2>Conclusion</h2>
          <p>
            The redesigned Brown Ballroom Dance website offers a more functional
            and visually appealing interface. By focusing on accessibility,
            usability, and responsive design, the new website provides a better
            platform for the team to share information and engage with visitors.
            The integration of various plug-in opportunities, such as Google
            Calendar, email subscriptions, social media links, and an
            announcements window, enhances the user experience and keeps the
            community well-informed and connected.
